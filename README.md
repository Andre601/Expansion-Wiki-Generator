# Expansion Wiki-Generator

This is a simple site used for generating new entries for an expansion on either the [Placeholder List](https://wiki.placeholderapi.com/users/placeholder-list/) or [List of Plugins using PlaceholderAPI](https://wiki.placeholderapi.com/users/plugins-using-placeholderapi/).

It's recommended to read the [Guide on how to Contribute](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI/blob/wiki/README.md) before starting anything.
